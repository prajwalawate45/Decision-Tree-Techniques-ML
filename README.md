# Decision-Tree-Techniques-ML
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring various decision tree techniques for classification and regression tasks. It includes implementations using popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, covering topics such as:

**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
**Decision Tree Classifier & Regressor:** Implementation and hyperparameter tuning.
**Pruning Methods:** Reducing overfitting using pre-pruning and post-pruning techniques.
**Feature Importance:** Analyzing which features contribute the most to model decisions.
**Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error.
**Visualization:** Plotting decision trees for better interpretability.
